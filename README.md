### Hello! 

##### My name is Kelsey Moore (she/her)

I am a statistics student at Brigham Young University, with an emphasis in applied statistics and analytics. This is my third year at BYU, and I am hoping to graduate with my bachelor's degree in April 2024.

After I graduate, I plan to move into my career, possibly in sports analytics or biostatistics. I would really like to get a job which would give me the opportunity to live in Europe for a few years (whether it is based in Europe, or fully remote). Until then, I am excited to be continuing my education and BYU and learning about both statistics and coding!
